# Skynet-MCP: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Skynet-MCP project, providing a roadmap for solo development with autonomous coding agents. The timeline is based on part-time development (approximately 3-4 hours per day) with AI assistance accelerating development.

## Project Approach

Rather than tackling the entire system at once, this plan adopts an iterative approach with clear milestones. Each component will be developed to a functional MVP state before advancing to the next, allowing for continuous testing and integration.

### Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Core System (Days 1-30)
Focus on building the fundamental dual-mode MCP server/client with basic agent creation and management. This phase establishes the foundation for all subsequent work.

#### Phase 2: Serverless Architecture (Days 31-52)
Implement the serverless deployment model, persistence layer, and security features. This phase makes the system production-ready and scalable.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Days 53-80)
Add sophisticated features, documentation, and polish. Conduct extensive testing and prepare for production deployment.

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team

- 1 Developer (you) working with:
  - Autonomous coding agents (Cline, Aider, Claude Code, Cursor)
  - LLM assistants for code generation, debugging, and testing

### Infrastructure

- Local development environment
- Simple cloud deployment for testing
- Streamlined CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Basic monitoring with CloudWatch or similar

### External Dependencies

- MCP SDK and related libraries
- LLM API access (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

## Autonomous Agent Development Strategy

### Leveraging AI Coding Assistants

#### Agent Selection & Specialization
- **Cline**: Best for incremental development and exploring codebases
- **Aider**: Excellent for multi-file changes and implementing features
- **Claude Code**: Helpful for architecture planning and complex algorithms
- **Cursor**: Strong for refactoring and debugging tasks

#### Effective Prompting Techniques

1. **Use Clear Task Definitions**
   - Break work into small, well-defined units
   - Specify inputs, outputs, and acceptance criteria
   - Reference existing patterns in the codebase

2. **Maintain Context**
   - Create documentation files that capture architectural decisions
   - Use consistent naming conventions across sessions
   - Periodically ask agents to summarize their understanding

3. **Iterative Development**
   - Start with skeleton implementations, then elaborate
   - Have agents generate tests before or alongside implementations
   - Review generated code thoroughly before proceeding

4. **Error Recovery**
   - When agents produce errors, focus on understanding rather than restarting
   - Guide agents with specific error details rather than vague instructions
   - Build a library of solutions to common problems

#### Development Workflow

1. **Morning Planning Session**
   - Define 2-3 clear tasks for the day
   - Review previous day's progress and identify blockers
   - Update documentation with current status

2. **Implementation Sessions**
   - Focus each agent on specific components
   - Regularly commit working code, even if incomplete
   - Use version control effectively (branches for features)

3. **Evening Review**
   - Test implementations against requirements
   - Document progress and remaining work
   - Identify areas where agents struggled

4. **Weekly Integration**
   - Dedicate time to integrate components
   - Run full test suites and fix integration issues
   - Refactor as needed based on emerging patterns

#### Specialized Workflows

- **API Design**: Use Claude to draft OpenAPI specs before implementation
- **Database Schemas**: Have agents generate schema definitions with validation
- **Testing**: Dedicated sessions for test creation and execution
- **Documentation**: Automate documentation from code comments and schemas
