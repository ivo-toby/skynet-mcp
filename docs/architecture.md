# Skynet-MCP: Architecture Design

## 1. Introduction

Skynet-MCP is an advanced architecture that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a hierarchical network of AI agents. The key innovation is that each Skynet-MCP instance acts as both an MCP server and MCP client, allowing it to provide tools to parent agents while also spawning and managing child agents.

This architecture enables recursive agent networks capable of decomposing complex tasks, parallelizing work, and integrating specialized capabilities across multiple models and services.

## 2. Core Architecture Components

### 2.1 Dual-Mode Operation

Each Skynet-MCP instance operates in two modes simultaneously:

- **Server Mode**: Exposes MCP capabilities to parent agents via Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport
- **Client Mode**: Connects to child agents and other MCP services as a client

### 2.2 Key System Components

1. **MCP Server Layer**
   - Implements MCP protocol server interface
   - Exposes tools and resources to parent agents
   - Manages authentication and authorization
   - Handles SSE transport for real-time communication

2. **Agent Orchestration Engine**
   - Manages agent lifecycle (creation, execution, monitoring, termination)
   - Maintains agent state and execution context
   - Implements hierarchical agent relationship model
   - Provides progress tracking and status reporting

3. **MCP Client Layer**
   - Connects to child agents and external MCP services
   - Manages client authentication and security
   - Handles transport protocols (SSE) for client connections
   - Translates tool interactions between agent levels

4. **Task Management System**
   - Decomposes complex tasks into subtasks
   - Assigns subtasks to appropriate child agents
   - Tracks subtask completion status
   - Aggregates and consolidates results

5. **Memory and Storage Layer**
   - Persists agent state and execution history
   - Caches frequently accessed data
   - Implements distributed memory architecture
   - Supports different storage backends (Redis, etc.)

## 3. Agent Hierarchy and Communication Flow

### 3.1 Agent Types

- **Coordinator Agent**: Top-level agent managing a task (receives initial user request)
- **Worker Agent**: Child agent handling a specific subtask
- **Specialist Agent**: Child agent with specialized capabilities (research, code generation, etc.)

### 3.2 Communication Flow

1. User or parent agent submits a task to Skynet-MCP
2. Coordinator agent analyzes the task and determines if subtasks are needed
3. If needed, coordinator spawns child agents via the `spawn_agent` tool
4. Child agents execute their tasks, potentially spawning their own child agents
5. Results propagate back up the hierarchy
6. Coordinator agent integrates and synthesizes results for final response

### 3.3 Inter-Agent Communication

- **Parent-to-Child**: Task delegation, constraints, and context passing
- **Child-to-Parent**: Status updates, intermediate results, and completion notifications
- **Sibling-to-Sibling**: Collaboration messages (optional, via parent mediation)

## 4. API and Endpoints

### 4.1 MCP Server Endpoints

- Standard MCP endpoints for tools, resources, etc.
- `/agent/create` - Spawn a new agent
- `/agent/status` - Get agent status
- `/agent/result` - Get agent execution results
- `/agent/terminate` - Terminate an agent

}
```

## 5. Tool Implementation

### 5.1 Core Tools

Skynet-MCP exposes several key tools to enable agent orchestration:

- **spawn_agent**: Creates a new child agent with specified parameters
  - Parameters: model, temperature, task description, tools, etc.
  - Returns: agentId for tracking

- **get_agent_status**: Checks status of a child agent
  - Parameters: agentId
  - Returns: status, progress, runtime information

- **get_agent_result**: Retrieves results from a completed child agent
  - Parameters: agentId
  - Returns: agent's output and any relevant metadata

- **terminate_agent**: Stops a running child agent
  - Parameters: agentId, terminationReason
  - Returns: termination status

### 5.2 Inherited Tools

Additionally, Skynet-MCP can expose any tools available from connected MCP servers, allowing them to be passed down to child agents as needed.

## 6. Memory and State Management

### 6.1 Agent State

Each agent instance maintains:

- Task context and instructions
- Current execution status
- References to parent and child agents
- Execution history and intermediate results
- Resource usage metrics

### 6.2 Persistence Strategies

Multiple persistence approaches supported:

- **In-Memory**: Fast access for short-lived agents
- **Redis**: Distributed memory for scaling and resilience
- **Database**: Long-term storage for complex agent hierarchies

### 6.3 State Recovery

- Checkpoint mechanisms to recover from failures
- Agent state serialization for portability
- Replay capability for debugging and analysis

## 7. Deployment Architectures

### 7.1 Serverless Model

For ephemeral, scalable deployments:

- SQS/EventBridge for inter-agent communication

### 7.2 Containerized Model

For persistent, managed deployments:

### 7.3 Hybrid Model

Combining approaches for flexibility:

- Long-running coordinator agents in containers
- Short-lived worker agents in serverless functions

- Isolated execution environments
- Ephemeral credentials for external service access

### 8.3 Resource Controls
